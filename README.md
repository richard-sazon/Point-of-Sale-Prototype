# Point-of-Sale-Prototype
A POS (Point of Sale) prototype capable of adding, editing, deleting, and listing out items in inventory. Uses C++.
This repository alone is not designed to download and use as an executable file.
It is solely just a place for me to archive and showcase my source code to others.
